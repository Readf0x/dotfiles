# Roll my own nvim config
Nvf is not as good as nixvim. It works a hell of a lot better but there are so
many subcategories it's hard to find the plugins I want, and there's default
config for just about everything.

I'm going to use [mnw](https://gerg-l.github.io/mnw/), or, if that fails, make my own module that generates a
lua file that returns a key value table of plugin names to their respective
store paths.
