# Determinate nix

Can be enabled by importing the module, it apparently just enables itself by
default which is a big no-no but whatever. Might do a lot of the setup is does
by itself manually because I don't trust corporate shit like this even if it's
open source. But if the eval times are faster it'll be worth it.
